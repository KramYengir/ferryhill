                      Treated ourselves to fish and chips, and we were not
                      disappointed. Met by friendly staff who had lovely smiles
                      on their faces as usual. The fish batter was crispy, the
                      chips are still the best in Irlam, crispy batter from
                      onion rings and a generous portion of scraps. Really
                      enjoyed this. Best chippy around üëç

                      Every time I come in this place I am served with well
                      cooked and tasty fish. The place is always very clean and
                      tidy and the personnel quite friendly with the customers.

                      Food is absolutely delicious. There are lots of choices. I
                      had cod chips and mushy peas and ate every bit. No
                      complaints at all. It is rare I think for a chippy to cook
                      good fish and chips. They are usually only good at one but
                      the Ferryhill is good at both.
